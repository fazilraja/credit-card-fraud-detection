# Example usage
# Load your dataset
# Assuming you have loaded your dataset into a variable 'data'
# and split it into features 'X' and label 'y'
file_path = 'creditcard.csv'  # Update the file path if needed
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)


# Normalize your features for better performance
X = (X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
# Implement your own function or use sklearn's train_test_split if available

# Create and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(learning_rate=0.001, num_iterations=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
# Implement your own accuracy calculation or use sklearn's metrics
